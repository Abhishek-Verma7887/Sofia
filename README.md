# About

In this hectic lifestyle, we all get so busy with our daily schedule & this is where we always forget to take care of ourselves. It is important for us to take care of our body and mind as well. This is where yoga comes into play.

Practitioners tout yoga for its mind-body benefits—flexibility, toned muscles, reduced stress, among others. More recently, scientists have begun to test yoga's effect on serious medical conditions. The results have been impressive enough that investigators expect yoga will soon become part of the standard treatment for a number of disorders.

Sofia will make sure that from fitness experts to railway workers, who are exceptionally busy do not have to travel to practise yoga. They can do so at any convenient place. 

With the advent of COVID-19, social distancing has become very important. People cannot visit gyms where there are a lot of people and chances to contact the virus. Hence, without fitness places, obesity will emerge more profoundly.

Sofia will let everyone practise yoga. There are yoga tracks for beginners to Power Yoga tracks for a workout. Now, more than ever, we need our immune systems to function better. We have the immunity booster yoga track. The cardiovascular track  helps increase blood flow to the muscles. The stress release track will make you feel relaxed and peaceful.

Most important part of any kind of exercise you do while watching a video is the posture. Maintaining correct posture while exercising is essential, as wrong postures can lead to body problems. Sofia recognizes in real time. As you follow the video and reach an intermediate step in each pose, it analyses the posture and lets you proceed only when you complete the step successfully.

We have gamified the app to let the users enjoy it more. They are awarded stars as points based on how good the accuracy of their pose is once they complete and progress through each step in the track. This ensures a fun and exciting approach to perfecting yoga postures.

## Features

- Interactive experience through **real time pose recognition** 

- **Voice recognition** which enables the user to engage in conversation

- Uses **computer vision and deep learning keras models** to guide you through every step of the asana only when you complete the previous step of the asana successfully.

- **Specifically designed yoga tracks/playlists** which are suited to the user's health issues, creating a more personalized experience

## How is Sofia diffrent from all the applications out there

Why would you choose Sofia? Simply because no other app out there implements **real time pose prediction technology**. Every time you are stuck on a step or an yogaasana, Sofia waits for you to complete it, and only then it gives intructions for the next asana, just like a personal yoga instructor who attends to you real time.

## Research proven benefits of yoga :


- Yoga can significantly improve mood and **reduc**e the symptoms of **depression** and anxiety.

- Women who do yoga during and after treatment of **breast cancer** experience **less** physical discomfort and stress.

## Requirement Specific Tracks

-  ### **POWER YOGA TRACK**
Adapted from the basic Ashtanga yoga, power yoga requires **increased energy, focus, and strength**. 
Muscles are challenged as the mind and body have to work together simultaneously to hold a position without giving up. Breathing, posing, moving, and increasing flexibility happen together at one time, which unearths a new level of **discipline** in your mind and body.

- ### **IMMUNITY** 
Yoga poses help massage organs and strengthens muscles while breathing techniques and meditation release stress and improve immunity.

- ### **YOGA IN PREGNANCY** 
Yoga is a great way to stay active and is healthy for you and your baby. Yoga classes in pregnancy use relaxation and breathing techniques with postures that are adapted for pregnancy.

- ### **INSOMNIA** 
Yoga isn’t just beneficial for improving core strength, flexibility, and stress levels; it can also help you sleep better—especially if you suffer from insomnia. When people who have insomnia perform yoga on a daily basis, they sleep for longer, fall asleep faster, and return to sleep more quickly if they wake up in the middle of the night. This is also true for older people who have insomnia—those who are 60 and older experience better sleep quality, sleep for longer, and feel better during the day when they perform regular yoga.


- ### **CARDIOVASCULAR YOGA TRACT**
Yoga to have a positive effect on cardiovascular risk factors: It helped lower blood pressure in people who have hypertension. It's likely that the yoga restores "baroreceptor sensitivity." 

- ### **MIGRAINE**
Migraine is a neurological disorder that causes recurring headaches ranging from moderate to high intensity. Yoga is a side-effect-free method to fight migraine. 

- ### **ASTHMA**
Yoga can help increase breath and body awareness, slow your respiratory rate, and promote calm and relieve stress — all of which are beneficial for people who have asthma.
